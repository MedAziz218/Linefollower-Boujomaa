# Linefollower-Boujomaa
This repository contains the initial codebase for my line-follower robot named Boujomaa. T

he robot utilizes encoders, TCRT5000 IR sensors, motor encoders, and an ESP32 microcontroller. 

The code is developed using PlatformIO and Arduino specifically for the ESP32 platform. 

Although the code is not complete, it was quickly crafted to participate in linefollower competitions. Future updates and optimizations are planned to enhance its performance and capabilities.
